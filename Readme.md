## HTML and CSS
- Style an id using #id; style a class using .class; style an element using nothing.
- Ways to deal with different screen sizes (responsive):
  1. Add ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">```in head to tell the mobile devices to use a viewport that is the same width as that of the device you're using rather than a much larger one.
  2. Through media queries.
  3. Through flexbox.
  4. Through grid.
  5. Including bootstrap in our html head by adding: ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOH8WgZl5MYYxFfc+NcPb1dKGj7Sk" crossorigin="anonymous">```
